        <p>To many Chinese youths of the era, Mao was revered as a hero 
          that freed China from the clutches of the Japanese and the 
          victory of the civil war against the Nationalists solidified 
          his glory. Mao had his ideals and "vision" written in what is
          called his "Little Red Book". The booklet was then printed in 
          millions and distributed to the entire population.
