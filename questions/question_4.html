        <p>The Great Leap Forward that happened prior to the Cultural Revolution
          was a complete failure that had damaged China's economy heavily and
          cost millions of lives with many still starving afterwards. The Cultural 
          Revolution as a result was not popular with adults. Mao's power within 
          the government had weakened due to the backlash from the Great Leap Forward. 
          Had the Great Leap Forward been successful, the Cultural Revolution could have 
          vastly changed or not even happen to begin with.
