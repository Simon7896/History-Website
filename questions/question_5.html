        <p>The use of propaganda was necessary in the making of the Cultural Revolution. 
          However, the most important propaganda used during the Cultural Revolution was the 
          "Little Red Book". This booklet would be the fuel to the fire that is the Cultural Revolution.
          The Red Guard that would be inspired by the words of Mao became the force that enforced the 
          policies that Mao put in place via the Gang of Four. People that were considered "intellectuals" 
          were harrased and schools, public facilities, and religous monuments were destroyed. 
          Without the Little Red Book there would be no Red Army, and no Red Guard means no Cultural Revolution.
